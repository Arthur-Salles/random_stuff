# kekdoro

This is kekdoro, my own version of pomodoro timers. 

1. What is pomodoro timer? 

A technique to increase produtivity, you will work for 25 minutes then 5 minutes rest

2. Why creating one since they already exists in the web? 


* I want to create a offline version 
* I though it would be cool to learn to use GUI 
- I have a desire to learn C++ and decided this is the time to do it
- I have some spare time
